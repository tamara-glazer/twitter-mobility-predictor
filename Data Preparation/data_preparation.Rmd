Datasets to pull in and join for IL:

1. County school closure date
2. UNACAST mobility indicators

```{r}
# County Analysis: IL (School Closures)
county_school <- read_csv("county_school_closures.csv")
county_school <- county_school %>% select(state_id, county, start_date, end_date) %>%
                                   dplyr::rename(state = state_id) %>%
                                   filter(state == "IL")

# Next get county level UNACAST mobility data
county_mobility <- read_csv("sds-v3-full-county (1).csv")
county_mobility <- county_mobility %>% filter(state_code == "IL") %>%
                                       select(state_code, county_fips, county_name, county_population, date,
                                              weekday, covid, grade_total,

# Calculate date diff (county)

                                                      units=c("days"))

# Create county_sip variable
county_school_mobility <- county_school_mobility %>% mutate(school_closure = ifelse(date > start_date, 1, 0)) %>%
                                                     mutate(school_closure = replace_na(school_closure, 0))

# We have mobility data for 2/24 to 5/17
write.csv(county_school_mobility, "school_mobility_county.csv", row.names=FALSE)
